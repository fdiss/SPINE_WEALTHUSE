	abstract = {Economic inequality may affect a wide range of societal outcomes, for example crime rates, economic growth, and political polarization. In this paper we discuss how to model such effects in welfarist frameworks. Our main suggestion is to treat economic inequality itself as an externality, which has wide-ranging implications for classical economic theory. We show this through the Mirrlees (1971) optimal non-linear income taxation model, where we focus on a post-tax income inequality externality. Optimal top marginal tax rates are particularly affected by the externality, implying a novel equality dimension to optimal top tax rate design. We propose that inequality’s externality properties may have larger optimal top tax rate implications than standard revenue concerns; our model thus provides a theoretical basis for real-world governmental tax choices that seem irrational under standard optimal taxation models. We also show that the total inequality aversion implied by the current U.S. tax system is insufficient to accommodate both social welfare weights that are decreasing in income and a significant concern for inequality’s externality effects.},

	abstract = {Rising wealth inequality and squeezed public budgets has brought wealth tax back into policy discussions. A net wealth tax might help to boost state revenue and reduce wealth inequality. Yet little is known about citizens’ attitudes towards the design of a net wealth tax (i.e. the tax unit, exemption and rate). Using a novel multifactorial survey experiment, we examine citizens’ endorsement of fundamental principles of taxation. Building on policy feedback theory, we examine if preferences differ in three policy arenas (USA, Germany and UK) and whether individuals’ reasoning is dependent on self-interest. While a clear majority in all three countries generally endorses a wealth tax, our findings show that citizens care more about the amount exempted than the tax unit or rate. We do not identify a preference for any specific tax unit. Furthermore, tax preferences seem to be strikingly similar among citizens of all three countries. Yet we show that individuals are mostly concerned about not being personally affected by such a tax, which is reflected in their preference for substantial exemptions. We discuss our findings with regard to our understanding of wealth inequality, tax equity and the potential implications for policymakers.},

	abstract = {Politicians, activists, and the rich themselves variously describe rich people as hard workers, greedy tax avoiders, generous philanthropists, and more. Occasionally, such descriptions are wielded in attempts to legitimize or delegitimize high income taxes on the rich. However, we do not have a good understanding of which of these appeals are most successful. This article explores which attributes of the rich affect support for progressive taxation. First, I use an inductive approach to derive relevant attributes from open-ended survey responses and prior literature. Then, pre-registered experiments in the United States and Denmark show that when the rich exhibit pro-social behaviors (e.g., treating workers well, not using tax loopholes), this reduces public support for taxing them. In comparison, indicators of merit (e.g., working hard) are of secondary or even insignificant importance. I conclude that in redistributive politics, the perceived pro-social behavior of the rich is a key consideration for the public.},

	abstract = {The public and social sciences debate how exactly citizens perceive economic and the extent to which misperceptions influence distributional policy preferences. The article examines this using the example of a wealth tax in Germany, which was suspended in 1996 and whose reintroduction is repeatedly called for. Is the tax burden on wealthy households - determined with the estimated top income tax rate - perceived in a distorted way and does this have consequences for the support of a wealth tax? An online survey empirically examines the effects of perceptions on the one hand and media framing of wealth taxes on the other. Respondents tend to estimate the tax burden of top income as too high. According to the data, the bias reduces political support for a wealth tax. But perceived fairness plays out as even stronger predictor compared to biased top tax esti-mates. The introduction of "taxes on the rich" moves in the field of tension between me-dia images of privileged wealth on the one hand and threats of the economy on the other to relocate their enterprises and diminish jobs. The struggle for public naming power in the mass media is fought out with specific frames. According to experiments, support for a wealth tax decreases significantly when frames activate possible job losses. Support for a wealth tax, finally, is uncertain the more political communication plays out the job frame.},

	abstract = {In most countries, wealth inequality is much higher than income inequality, spurring debates about wealth taxation. However, it is unclear if voters are aware of these differences. In a largescale survey experiment among a representative Dutch population (N=4,501), we study voters' perceptions of income and wealth distributions, and connect their views to administrative data about their own income and wealth. Despite a primer on the definition of income and wealth, respondents underestimate the difference between the top 10\% share of income and wealth by a factor of 10. Moreover, they use information about the income distribution to make predictions about the wealth distribution and vice versa, even when information about both is provided, further demonstrating confusion about the two types of inequality. An information intervention about actual inequality levels and personal ranks in the income/wealth distribution has an impact on the perceived inequality and perceived fairness of inequality, but little effect on policy preferences. We discuss implications for political debates about inequality and wealth taxation.},
